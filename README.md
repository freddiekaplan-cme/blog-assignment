# Blog Site Assignment

The final assignment of a Webbserver and Database course. We were given a shell of a minimal blog site made in Next js then worked on connecting it to a Supabase database.

## What I Used

- CRUD
- Database management
- Middleware
- Next js
- NPM Packages
- Supabase

## What I learned

A challenging but ultimately very rewarding assignment. There are few things in life thart are as good as getting a database connection to work. I worked hard on this and learned a lot.

You can find the site here, but due to the Supabase Free account restrictions it will probably be devoid of content.
